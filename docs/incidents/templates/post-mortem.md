## Root Cause

_Describe the technical root cause in detail. Be specific — "database was slow" is not enough; "a missing index on `escrows.status` caused a full table scan on every list request" is._

## Contributing Factors

- Factor 1
- Factor 2

---

## What Went Well

- We detected the issue within X minutes via Sentry/PagerDuty
- The runbook covered this scenario
- Communication was clear and timely

---

## What Went Poorly

- Alert threshold was too high — we should have been paged sooner
- Runbook step X was outdated
- We didn't have a staging environment to test the fix
