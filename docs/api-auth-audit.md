# API Authentication and Authorization Audit

Date: `2026-03-27`

This audit reviewed every backend API route for:

- Authentication coverage
- Resource-level authorization
- Administrative endpoint isolation
- Public endpoint justification

## Summary

The backend previously mixed app-level route guards, per-route admin checks, webhook signatures, and several completely open sensitive endpoints. The result was inconsistent enforcement and multiple horizontal-access risks for wallet-scoped resources.

This pass standardizes protection as follows:

- Sensitive user routes are protected in the router itself with JWT auth.
- Wallet-scoped endpoints enforce ownership using the wallet address embedded in the JWT.
- Internal/admin operations use `x-admin-api-key`.
- Webhook endpoints remain public but rely on provider signature verification.
- Public read-only endpoints remain explicitly documented as public.

## Implementation Notes

- JWTs now carry `address` when the user account is linked to a wallet address.
- `users.wallet_address` is persisted so ownership checks do not rely on client-supplied headers.
- Ownership middleware fails closed when the authenticated user has no linked wallet address.

## Tests Added

- Router protection tests for JWT-, admin-, and token-protected routes
- Payment controller authorization tests for session and refund ownership
