# Frontend Testing Strategy

The frontend test pyramid is split into four layers so regressions are caught at the cheapest level possible:

- Unit tests cover isolated UI components, hooks, and utility modules with Jest + Testing Library.
- Integration tests cover page-level flows and state transitions with mocked network responses.
- Accessibility tests run `jest-axe` against reusable UI patterns.
- End-to-end tests use Playwright for navigation, visual regression, and performance smoke checks.

## Commands

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:a11y
npm run test:coverage
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:visual:update
npm run test:perf
```

## Coverage Goals

- Statements: 60%
- Lines: 60%
- Functions: 60%
- Branches: 50%

## Testing State Hooks & Store

**SWR Hooks** (mock `useSWR`):

```jsx
import { renderHook } from '@testing-library/react';

test('loading/error/mutate', () => {
  const mockMutate = jest.fn();
  useSWR.mockReturnValue({ data: null, error: null, isLoading: true, mutate: mockMutate });
  const { result } = renderHook(() => useEscrow('123'));
  expect(result.current.isLoading).toBe(true);
});
```

**WebSocket Hooks** (mock `WebSocket` class):

```jsx
global.WebSocket = class MockWebSocket {
  /* simulate open/close/message */
};
const { result } = renderHook(() => useEscrowUpdates('123'));
```

**Store** (custom `renderWithStore` wrapper):

```jsx
// Persists to mock localStorage
const { result } = renderWithStore(<ComponentUsingWalletStore />);
fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /connect/ }));
```

## CI Expectations

- Every pull request runs frontend lint, build, unit, integration, a11y, and coverage checks.
- Playwright runs smoke, visual, and performance tests on Node 20 with browser artifacts uploaded on failure.
- Visual baselines live beside the Playwright specs so regressions show up in code review.
