## 3. Methodology

**Approach:** This audit combined automated static analysis with manual code review.

**Tools used:**

| Tool               | Version   | Purpose                                    |
| ------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Slither            | [version] | Automated vulnerability detection          |
| `cargo audit`      | [version] | Dependency vulnerability scanning          |
| Kani Rust Verifier | [version] | Formal verification of critical invariants |
| `cargo-llvm-cov`   | [version] | Test coverage measurement                  |

**Manual review areas:**

- Access control: verified `require_auth()` / `require_admin()` on all state-mutating functions
- Arithmetic safety: verified `checked_*` usage on all numeric operations
- State machine transitions: traced all `EscrowStatus` / `MilestoneStatus` paths
- Cross-contract call ordering: verified checks-effects-interactions pattern
- Storage key namespacing: verified `DataKey` variants do not collide
- Input validation: verified non-zero amount guards, deadline sanity checks, hash length validation

**Severity rating scale:**

| Severity      | Criteria                                                                   |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Critical      | Direct fund loss or theft possible; exploitable without special conditions |
| High          | Significant fund loss or access control bypass under realistic conditions  |
| Medium        | Partial fund loss, griefing, or logic error with limited impact            |
| Low           | Best-practice deviation; no direct fund impact                             |
| Informational | Code quality, documentation, or gas optimisation suggestion                |

## 5. Finding Detail Pages

Each finding gets its own subsection below. Copy the appropriate template (Critical/High or Medium/Low/Informational) for each entry.

### FINDING-001 — [Title]

**Severity:** Critical  
**Affected function:** `[contract::module::function_name]`  
**Location:** `contracts/[contract]/src/lib.rs:[line]`  
**Status:** Open

#### Description

[Explain what the vulnerability is, why it exists in this codebase, and what an attacker could achieve by exploiting it.]

#### Recommendation

[Describe the concrete code change required to fix the issue. Reference the relevant Rust/Soroban pattern, e.g., "add `require_auth()` before mutating state", "replace `+` with `checked_add(...).ok_or(EscrowError::Overflow)?`".]

#### Proof of Concept / Reproduction Steps

> **Required for Critical and High findings. This section must not be left empty.**

1. Deploy the contract to a local Soroban sandbox: `stellar contract deploy ...`
2. Invoke the vulnerable function with the following parameters:
   ```bash
   stellar contract invoke \
     --id [CONTRACT_ID] \
     --fn [function_name] \
     -- \
     --param1 [value] \
     --param2 [value]
   ```
3. Observe that [describe the unexpected/malicious outcome].
4. Expected behaviour: [describe what should have happened].

Alternatively, provide a minimal Rust test that reproduces the issue:

```rust
#[test]
fn poc_finding_001() {
    // Set up environment
    let env = Env::default();
    // ... reproduce the vulnerability ...
    // assert the unexpected outcome
}
```

#### Resolution

> Fill in after the finding is remediated.

[Describe how the issue was fixed, referencing the commit or PR that introduced the fix.]
