## Escrow Concepts

**Escrow**
A contractual arrangement in which a neutral third party (in Trustchain's case, a
Soroban smart contract) holds funds on behalf of two transacting parties until
pre-agreed conditions are met. Unlike a traditional bank-held escrow, Trustchain
escrows are held entirely on-chain with no human intermediary.

**Client (Funder)**
The party that deposits funds into an escrow. The client approves milestone
completion and, in the event of a dispute, is one of the two principals who may
submit evidence to an arbiter. Also referred to as the *buyer* or *project owner*
in some contexts.

**Contractor (Freelancer)**
The party that receives milestone-gated payments from an escrow in exchange for
delivering agreed work. The contractor submits milestones with on-chain deliverable
hashes and builds an immutable reputation from the outcome. Also referred to as the
*seller* or *service provider*.

**Arbiter**
A trusted third party (human or multi-sig) with on-chain authority to resolve
disputes. The arbiter calls `submit_ruling` to split escrowed funds between client
and contractor as a percentage. Arbiter identity is recorded at escrow creation
and cannot be changed after funding.

**Timelock**
An optional Unix timestamp set at escrow creation after which, if no milestone has
been approved, the contract automatically transitions to `Expired` and the client
may reclaim deposited funds. Timelocks are enforced by Soroban ledger time, not a
backend cron job.

**Funding Token**
The Stellar asset (XLM or a SAC-wrapped token) locked inside an escrow contract.
The token address is fixed at creation; both parties see the same on-chain token
balance at all times.

**Allowance**
Before calling `create_escrow`, the client must authorize the escrow contract to
transfer the funding token on their behalf using the Stellar token's `approve`
function. This is equivalent to an ERC-20 approval.

## Milestone and Lifecycle Terms

**Milestone**
A discrete, value-carrying unit of work within an escrow. Each milestone has:
- a description hash (SHA-256 of the deliverable specification)
- an amount in the funding token
- a completion status (`Pending`, `Submitted`, `Approved`, `Disputed`)

Milestones are defined at escrow creation and cannot be added or removed after the
contract is deployed.

**Deliverable Hash**
A SHA-256 or IPFS CID that the contractor records on-chain when submitting a
milestone. The hash anchors the off-chain deliverable (code, design file, report,
etc.) to an immutable on-chain record, giving the client proof that the submitted
work existed at a specific ledger sequence.

**IPFS CID (Content Identifier)**
A self-describing, content-addressed identifier produced by hashing a file with
SHA-256 (CIDv1). Trustchain stores IPFS CIDs on-chain as deliverable references so
that evidence cannot be silently replaced or deleted by either party.

**Escrow States**

| State       | Description                                                       |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Active`    | Escrow is funded; milestones are in progress.                     |
| `Disputed`  | One party raised a dispute; awaiting arbiter ruling.              |
| `Completed` | All milestones approved or arbiter ruling finalised.              |
| `Cancelled` | Both parties consented to cancel; funds returned to client.       |
| `Expired`   | Timelock elapsed without completion; client may auto-refund.      |

**Incremental Release**
The pattern of releasing funds one milestone at a time rather than all at once.
Only the approved milestone's allocation is transferred to the contractor; the
remainder stays locked in the contract until subsequent approvals.

---

## Dispute and Reputation Terms

**Dispute**
A formal on-chain claim raised by either the client or contractor when they believe
the other party has breached the escrow terms. Raising a dispute transitions the
escrow to `Disputed` and freezes all further milestone submissions until an arbiter
resolves it.

**Evidence Hash**
An array of IPFS CIDs or SHA-256 hashes submitted alongside a dispute claim. These
hashes anchor screenshots, communications, deliverables, or any other evidence to
the on-chain dispute record.

**Ruling**
The arbiter's binding on-chain decision that allocates a percentage of the locked
funds to the client and the remainder to the contractor. Percentages must sum to
100. The ruling is irreversible once submitted.

**ReputationEvent**
An on-chain event emitted when an escrow reaches a terminal state (`Completed` or
`Cancelled`). Each event records the outcome (win, loss, neutral) for both parties'
Stellar addresses. Reputation scores are derived by aggregating all `ReputationEvent`
records for an address across every escrow they have participated in.

**Reputation Score**
A derived metric computed from all `ReputationEvent` records for a Stellar address.
It is public, immutable, portable across dApps, and queryable directly from the
Soroban contract. See [docs/reputation-scoring.md](reputation-scoring.md) for the
scoring algorithm.

## Stellar Network Terms

**Stellar**
A public, open-source blockchain network optimised for fast, low-cost asset
transfers and programmable financial logic via the Soroban smart contract runtime.
Stellar uses the Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) consensus protocol.

**XLM (Lumen)**
The native asset of the Stellar network, used to pay transaction fees and maintain
account reserves. XLM can be used directly as the funding token in a Trustchain
escrow.

**Stellar Address**
A base32-encoded public key (e.g. `GBBD47...`) that identifies an account on the
Stellar network. Both client and contractor identities in an escrow are stored as
Stellar addresses.

**Stellar Asset Contract (SAC)**
A Soroban-compatible wrapper that exposes any Stellar Classic asset (e.g. USDC,
BTC-pegged tokens) through the standard SEP-41 token interface, allowing it to be
used as a funding token in escrow contracts.

**Freighter**
The browser extension wallet most commonly used to sign Stellar transactions in
Trustchain's web dashboard. Freighter holds the user's private key and approves
on-chain operations without exposing the key to the application.

**Horizon**
Stellar's public REST API for reading blockchain state — transactions, operations,
account balances, and ledger entries. Trustchain's backend queries Horizon for
transaction confirmation and event history.

**Soroban RPC**
A JSON-RPC endpoint that accepts and simulates Soroban smart contract invocations
before they are submitted to the network. Trustchain uses Soroban RPC to build,
simulate, and broadcast contract transactions.

**Ledger Sequence**
An incrementing integer that identifies each closed ledger (block) on the Stellar
network. Timelocks and event timestamps are expressed in ledger sequences or Unix
timestamps derived from them.

**Testnet**
Stellar's public test network, which mirrors mainnet functionality but uses
worthless test XLM obtainable from the Friendbot faucet. All Trustchain development
and staging deployments target Testnet.

**Mainnet**
The live Stellar production network where real assets are transacted. Trustchain
mainnet deployments are pending a full smart contract security audit.

## Soroban Smart Contract Terms

**Soroban**
Stellar's WebAssembly (Wasm) smart contract platform. Contracts are written in Rust,
compiled to Wasm, and deployed on-chain. Soroban provides deterministic execution,
formal storage metering, and a type-safe host environment.

**Contract ID**
A unique identifier for a deployed Soroban contract. Trustchain contract IDs are
listed in the README under [Smart Contract Addresses](../README.md#smart-contract-addresses).

**Wasm**
WebAssembly — the binary instruction format into which Soroban Rust contracts are
compiled. The Wasm blob is stored on-chain and executed by the Soroban host.

**Env (`soroban_sdk::Env`)**
The Soroban host environment object passed to every contract function. `Env`
provides access to on-chain storage, cryptographic utilities, cross-contract calls,
ledger metadata, and event emission.

**Storage (`Env::storage()`)**
Soroban's key-value persistence layer. Trustchain uses `Persistent` storage for
escrow state (survives ledger expiry cycles) and `Temporary` storage for short-lived
nonces. See [contracts/escrow_contract/src/storage.rs](../contracts/escrow_contract/src/storage.rs).

**Authorization (`require_auth`)**
A Soroban host call that enforces that a specific `Address` signed the current
transaction. Trustchain calls `client.require_auth()` before releasing funds and
`contractor.require_auth()` before submitting milestones.

**Simulation**
A dry-run of a Soroban invocation via Soroban RPC that returns estimated resource
usage and the expected return value without committing to the ledger. The frontend
always simulates before broadcasting to catch errors early.

**Footprint**
The set of ledger entries a Soroban transaction declares it will read or write.
The Soroban host validates that the transaction only accesses entries in its
declared footprint, preventing unexpected side effects.

## API and Backend Terms

**Bearer JWT**
A JSON Web Token passed as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every authenticated
API request. Tokens are issued by `POST /api/v1/auth/login` and expire after a
configurable interval. Refresh logic is handled automatically by the frontend API
client in `frontend/lib/api/client.js`.

**Tenant**
A logical namespace that isolates escrow data, API keys, and webhook subscriptions
for a single organisation or product integrating Trustchain. See
[docs/multi-tenant-architecture.md](multi-tenant-architecture.md).

**BullMQ**
The Redis-backed job queue used by Trustchain's backend to deliver webhook callbacks
with exponential backoff and dead-letter visibility. See [docs/webhooks.md](webhooks.md).

**Cursor-based Pagination**
The pagination strategy used by all list endpoints (e.g. `GET /api/v1/escrows`).
Instead of page numbers, each response includes an opaque `nextCursor` token derived
from the last returned row's primary key, ensuring stable results even when rows are
inserted concurrently.

**Prisma**
The TypeScript ORM used by Trustchain's backend. Schema definitions live in
`backend/database/schema.prisma`; migration history is stored in
`backend/database/migrations/`.
